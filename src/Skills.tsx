            I have strong programming skills in Python, Java, C++, R, TypeScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS, with hands-on experience using frameworks and libraries such as React, Node.js, PyTorch, and NumPy. I’m comfortable working in collaborative development environments using Git and following Agile and Scrum methodologies. In addition, I am fluent in Spanish, which supports effective communication in bilingual teams and diverse settings
