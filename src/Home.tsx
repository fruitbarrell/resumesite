        <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a 21-year-old senior at the University of Delaware pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in AI and Robotics. I am eager to gain hands-on professional experience and apply my academic knowledge in real-world engineering and software development environments.
        I have a strong interest in machine learning, automation, and building efficient, scalable systems. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science to further specialize in advanced computing and intelligent systems.
        Outside of academics, I enjoy cooking and playing video games, interests that reflect my creativity, problem-solving mindset, and appreciation for well-designed systems.
